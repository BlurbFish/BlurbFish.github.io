        <h2>Week 4: Understanding the STEP Model for Inclusive Practice</h2>
        <div class="activity">
          <h3>Activity 1: Introduction to the STEP Model</h3>
          <p>Objective: Understand the components of the STEP model and their importance in adapting physical education sessions.</p>
          <p>Description: In this activity, teachers will be introduced to the STEP model (Space, Time, Equipment, People) and its significance in creating inclusive physical education sessions. They will explore the components of the model and understand how each aspect plays a crucial role in promoting inclusivity. Teachers will study relevant research articles and literature to deepen their knowledge and understanding of the STEP model.</p>

          <h3>Activity 2: Applying the STEP Model - Space and Time</h3>
          <p>Objective: Learn how to adapt the space and time aspects of physical education sessions to promote inclusion.</p>
          <p>Description: In this activity, teachers will delve into the space and time components of the STEP model. They will explore strategies to create inclusive learning environments by modifying the physical space and adjusting the timing of activities. Teachers will analyze case studies and research articles to gain insights into practical applications of adapting space and time. They will also discuss and share their own experiences in adapting these aspects of physical education sessions.</p>

          <h3>Activity 3: Applying the STEP Model - Equipment and People</h3>
          <p>Objective: Learn how to adapt the equipment and people aspects of physical education sessions to promote inclusion.</p>
          <p>Description: In this activity, teachers will focus on the equipment and people components of the STEP model. They will explore strategies to adapt and modify equipment to meet the diverse needs of students in physical education. Additionally, teachers will learn how to engage and involve individuals with different abilities and backgrounds to create an inclusive learning environment. They will examine case studies, research articles, and resources that highlight effective practices in adapting equipment and engaging diverse participants. Teachers will reflect on their own experiences and discuss the implementation of these strategies in their teaching context.</p>
