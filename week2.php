          <h3>Activity 1: Workshop on Evidence-Based Practices</h3>
          <p>Objective: Develop knowledge of evidence-based practices for inclusive physical education.</p>
          <p>Description: In this activity, teachers will participate in a workshop that focuses on evidence-based practices for inclusive physical education. They will explore research studies and literature that highlight effective strategies and approaches to create inclusive environments. Teachers will analyze and discuss the findings to gain insights into practical applications in their own teaching context.</p>
          <h4>Readings:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>"Effective Inclusive Physical Education Practices: A Review of Literature" by Smith and Thomas (2018)</li>
            <li>"Inclusive Physical Education: Research to Practice" by Block and Porter (2019)</li>
            <li>"Promoting Inclusion in Physical Education: A Systematic Review of Literature" by Chen and Liu (2020)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Success criteria: Teachers will be able to identify evidence-based practices for inclusive physical education and explain their relevance in promoting inclusive environments.</p>

          <h3>Activity 2: Case Study Analysis</h3>
          <p>Objective: Analyze successful inclusive physical education initiatives.</p>
          <p>Description: In this activity, teachers will analyze case studies of successful inclusive physical education initiatives. They will examine real-world examples of inclusive practices and explore the strategies, adaptations, and approaches used to create inclusive environments. Teachers will critically evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives and reflect on how they can adapt and apply the learnings in their own teaching context.</p>
          <h4>Readings:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>"Inclusion in Physical Education: Case Studies of Successful Practices" by Johnson and Davis (2017)</li>

          <h3>Activity 3: Practical Session - Differentiated Instruction Techniques</h3>
          <p>Objective: Develop practical skills in using differentiated instruction techniques to meet diverse student needs.</p>
          <p>Description: In this activity, teachers will engage in a practical session focused on differentiated instruction techniques for inclusive physical education. They will learn about differentiating instruction based on student abilities, interests, and learning styles. Teachers will explore various strategies, such as modifying activities, providing alternative assessments, and adapting equipment, to create inclusive learning experiences for all students.</p>
          <p>Success criteria: Teachers will demonstrate their ability to apply differentiated instruction techniques in a practical session and explain how these techniques promote inclusivity.</p>
